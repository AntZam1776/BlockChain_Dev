Issue Screenshots... 

This is the same errors from before, not sure if maybe I need to recreate my conda environment but everything seems to be running accordingly... I did uninstall and reinstall the streamlit module which did update it from streamlit 1.4.0 to streamlit 1.6.0, or something like that... Same issue occured... I double checked my mnemonic, double checked my private network and Ganache... Not sure where I'm going wrong here... I included some screenshot to show everything should be working correctly since updated missing the w3 through 'get_people(w3)'.
